        The Lab-grown diamonds are less expensive and avoid the burden of the natural procedures of a naturally mined stone. The differences between man-made and natural are so subtle, they are incredibly difficult to identify without using sophisticated spectroscopy. We offer millions of combinations of style, finishes, metals, and settings with precious gemstones. The standard and quality of the diamond is determined by the Cut, Clarity and Color.

            <span class="text-lg font-semibold mb-5">Pave setting :</span>
            <p class="leading-8 text-justify">Pave setting is a method where the surface of a jewelry item appears to be covered with tiny diamonds. These multiple-sized diamonds are placed in small holes which are drilled out on the surface of the jewelry. Pave setting has small holes, triangular in shape which holds the stones low and very close so that they produce a brilliance across the entire surface of a jewelry item. The use of multiple stones in pave setting forms an illusion of bigger jewelry. This setting gives the best results with diamonds and white gold.</p>

            <span class="text-lg font-semibold mb-5">Tension Setting :</span>
            <p class="leading-8 text-justify">It is a relatively new type of setting in which metal pressure is used to hold a stone. In this method, the metal is attached apart and the girdle of the stone is settled into small grooves in the inner surface of the metal. Tension settingrequires strong metals to create sufficient tension and pressure to hold a stone firmly and platinum is often used for this purpose.</p>

            <span class="text-lg font-semibold mb-5">Channel setting :</span>
            <p class="leading-8 text-justify">Channel setting is a method in which gemstones are placed side by side held in between two parallel tracks on each metal wall. This setting gives the impression of stones in the jewelry items and produces the maximum amount of light as no metal appears in-between the gemstones. The Channel setting protects the gemstones and none of the stone's edges are exposed, which are safe from hard knocks and general wear and tear.</p>

            <span class="text-lg font-semibold mb-5">Invisible setting :</span>
            <p class="leading-8 text-justify">An invisible setting is an improved method that is considered as one of the most difficult in which the stones are positioned in such a manner so that metal is not visible from in-between stones. This setting is appropriate only for the multi-stone arrangement that is usually attached in multiple rows. Usually, an invisible setting is best suited with a square princess, emerald, baguette, and trillion cut diamonds and gemstones because the straight edges can be positioned very close to each other without leaving any space in-between.</p>
